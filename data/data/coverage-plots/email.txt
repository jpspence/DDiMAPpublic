A few samples.  Easier to see if printed out (PDF maker on Linux box is 
challenged in Landscape mode).

The first one is from 383-LN-4, with a total coverage of the J1-Emu of 210000.
It shows counts in single digits starting around 1450 (inside J6-J5 by my 
reckoning so possibly a J5?), a step up to values in the tens starting around 
2450 (possibly a J6?) , another step up to values in the hundreds starting at 
2550 (??), and then finally stepping up again to values in the thousands 
starting at 3600(????).

The stepping up behavior seems reasonable except for the places at which they 
happen.  It would seem remarkable that this specimen (which is mostly LN of 
course) has no coverage below J5.

Next look at one of the hodgkin's cases - 244 -it has an apparent clone with 
40% of the V reads mapping to Vh1-24 (all the other specimens had values from 
0 to 1.5%).  It had one third of the J1-Emu coverage of the 4% 383 in LN and 
shows a very similar pattern, with the lowest group nearly disappearing due 
to the coverage loss.  Maybe it is a J6, but...

Finally look at the Spleen specimen.  Again it show breakpoints in very similar 
locations and a very similar pattern with J1-Emu total coverage of nearly 350K.

There is clearly something going on here but I am mystified.
